# QnAChatBot

### [Live Demo](https://qnachatbotgit-wt3gsf18sv.streamlit.app/)

QnAChatBot allows you to upload text heavy pdf documents, and chat with the bot based on the document.

## Use Cases
1. Company financials, and earnings call analyzer.
2. Ask questions about a Terms and Services document to uncover what you're legally signing up for.
3. Write cover letters based on resumes.
4. Ask questions on course work, lab materials, or any educational document


## Prior Work

This work is inspired from my HackNYU Hackathon project, [GPT Tutor](https://devpost.com/software/tutor-bot). We built a Discord Bot that is able
to synthesize course material uploaded by a professor, and serve as a 24/7 available teacher's assistant. The success of the work enables us to expand beyond
just coursework, and extend it to a wider usecase.
